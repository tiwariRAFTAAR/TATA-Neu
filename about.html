          Tata Sons confirmed the appointment. People involved in building Tata
          Neu have echoed Chandrasekaran's involvement in the project. “Not just
          Mukesh and Pratik, but he has been involved with new-age founders and
          other key executives at Tata Digital while building out the Tata Neu
          up. This is also a big opportunity for him to showcase how he is
          taking an traditional Indian conglomerate into the fast growing
          internet economy in India,” a person who has worked with the Tata Sons
          chairman

            The newly-launched Tata Neu app, which houses major Tata Group brands
            from Tata Croma to BigBasket, will be open to brands outside of the
            group, executive Chairman N Chandrasekaran indicated while addressing
            a press conference to mark the launch of the app. “Our aim is to
            ensure that Neu becomes a super app which simplifies the life of every
            consumer from a product, services and financial needs point of view.
            And for that the offerings may come from the Tata table or it may come
            from outside,” he added. Tata Digital had launched the much-awaited
            Neu app last week. The app houses most Tata brands except for Vistara,
            Air India, Titan, Tanishq, Tata Motors, which are expected to join the
            platform soon.

            pheonomenal response and has been downloaded 2.2 million times.
